# My Daily Rituals (a.k.a. Hobbies)

## Hello, Hooman.

I'm Kastana. I’m sleek, shadowy, and fabulous. You might call them "hobbies," but for me, these are sacred daily rituals that must not be interrupted.

## My Favorite Things to Do

### 🌞 Sunbeam Chasing
Windows were made for sunbeams, and sunbeams were made for me. If there’s a warm patch on the floor, you better believe I’m on it—centered, stretched, majestic.

### 👀 Birdwatching (a.k.a. Recon Missions)
From my post by the balcony, I observe enemy pigeon movements. One day, I *will* figure out how to get through the glass. Until then, they taunt me.

### 🧶 String Wars
Loose threads, hoodie strings, dangling earbuds—no string is safe in this household. I attack swiftly. I retreat dramatically.

### 👻 The 3AM Zoomies
Some say it’s chaotic. I call it performance art. Every night around 3AM, I summon the energy of a thousand ghosts and sprint like my tail’s on fire.

### 🛏️ Midday Naps
Why just nap when you can nap in style? I rotate between the couch, the laptop keyboard, the laundry pile, and sometimes… your freshly folded clothes.

## Final Words

Life’s better when you take it one sunbeam at a time. If you’re ever stressed, just find a cozy corner, curl up, and ignore everyone. Works for me every time.
