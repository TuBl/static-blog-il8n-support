# The Story of Kastana

## Who is Kastana?

Kastana is not your average black cat. Her name means "chestnut" in Arabic, a little ironic for a sleek shadow who prowls through my apartment like a silent guardian. She's curious, demanding, and deeply affectionateâ€”on her own terms, of course.

## Kastanaâ€™s Daily Adventures

### Morning Routine
- **Sunbathing by the window**: No matter how cold it is outside, Kastana always finds the one warm beam of sunlight to stretch out in.
- **Bird Surveillance Unit**: She perches near the balcony door, eyes tracking every pigeon like a seasoned scout.

### Mischief & Mood Swings
- **Phantom Paw Swipes**: Kastana has a habit of swiping at shadows, cables, and sometimes, my ankleâ€”just because.
- **Zoomies at 3 AM**: Every night like clockwork, she becomes a rocket, dashing from room to room for no apparent reason.

### Mealtime Demands
- **Precision Meowing**: If her breakfast is even 5 minutes late, she lets me knowâ€”with increasing volume.
- **Disdain for Cheap Treats**: Kastana is a connoisseur. Not all treats are created equal in her eyes.

## What Kastana Taught Me

### Patience and Presence
Living with a cat means learning to enjoy the quiet moments. Kastana will curl up next to me during long work sessions, reminding me to take breaks.

### Routine is Everything
Kastana thrives on predictability. Her internal clock rivals any smartwatch, and she's made mine better in the process.

### Love Looks Different
She might not always want to be held, but when Kastana chooses to sit in your lap or purr beside you, it means everything.
